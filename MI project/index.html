				<p>You probably arrived to this page because you are interested in working with ISRA. We receive many unsolicited applications from people enquiring about jobs. While this is flattering and we hear from a lot of interesting and competent people, we simply don’t have time to reply to them all.

			<h3>Invisible surveillance!</h3>
			<p>
				ISRA provides advanced implementations of surveillance and security technologies, tailored to the unique needs of our clients. We frequently provide installations that are completely invisible to a third party. Unique installations of this kind are very difficult to spot, also for people with experience of security technologies, and thus provide substantial advantage for our clients.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="knowleg">
			<div class="howDoesPic"></div>
			<div>
				<h3>How does it work?</h3>
			<p>
				Our knowledgeable security engineers install sound or video recording equipment in furniture or objects typical to the surveyed environment, such as microwave ovens in the kitchen, toys in the crèche, or power sockets or outlets in just about any room. Installations of this type blend perfectly with their environment and resist detection. The same type of implementations can be installed in cars or other vehicles. Successful advanced implementation requires that our technicians are well informed in advance about the layout of your particular location. 
				Make contact and discuss your particular needs!

		</div>
		<div class="invisible">
			<h3>Security screening of office or home & securing locations</h3>
			<p>
				ISRA protects your home, office environment or temporary locations from bugging, eavesdropping and other forms of integrity breaches or espionage. While digital technologies involve new risks to your corporate and private integrity, all of the old threats of acoustic bugging and video surveillance remain. Our corporate clients frequently turn to us to investigate and eliminate the risk of electronic eavesdropping, typically prior to the relocation to new offices or in advance of events in conference facilities.

		</div>
		<div class="personalInt">
			<div>
				<h3>Personal integrity preparedness </h3>
			<p>
				Individuals have different reasons to wish to control the amount of personal information that they make publicly accessible. ISRA helps victims of crime, high-net-worth individuals, celebrities and individuals who for other reasons take their personal integrity seriously, to monitor, control and reduce public exposure in everyday life, business and travel. ISRA boasts the state-of-the-art equipment and expertise to assist clients serious about their IT-security preparedness. Beyond swift and effective response to network breaches and other incidents, we help our clients improve their IT-security

			<h3>Who needs physical protection?</h3>
			<p>
				The needs and circumstances that compel individuals to request our private security services differ, but we commonly accept assignments from executives and high net-worth individuals particularly exposed to risk. Another client category consists of individuals affected by stalking or other crimes, where the legal authorities might not provide the necessary security support. In each case, ISRA is there to listen, advice and provide for your particular security needs.

				People are very creative when the lie, and when they managed to do this for a long time ( many time for more than 10-15 years), they get good at it. They lie, and you- as his partner don't see the signs, and you dont see anything abnormal. We seen people boarding a plane without actually beeing on the flight. We've seen cheaters having multiple affairs at once, and we seen cheaters living a double life. The list continues; We see people having totally another activities on that business trip, we seen neighbours having affairs and many other things. All this is buiding up an experience.
				Our investigators know the patterns to look for when monitoring suspected cheaters. We know how cheaters hide their tracks, and we know how to catch them red handed. We even know the type of lies they tell their partners. Most important of all we know how to catch them.

				Individuals hire ISRA for any circumstance where surveillance is needed to shine a light on a situation. Some of the most common reasons for private investigations for individuals are: suspicions of an unfaithful partner and parents wanting to know more about what their children do in their spare time. People who believe their partner is cheating or, are worried about whether or not their child is lying about their after school activities often hire ISRA to shed light on the situation and get the facts straight before any confrontation occurs.

						ISRA’s professional surveillance services are are tailored to meet each individuals needs- and we have the resources and skills to make sure that we do just that. Unfortunately, failed surveillance is often caused by amateur services or so called private detectives who work individually. Aside from alerting the suspect and losing the evidence, this can put a person's personal relationships at risk. We respect an individual's private life therefore we will ensure your surveillance needs are always handled professionally with a level of compassion.
